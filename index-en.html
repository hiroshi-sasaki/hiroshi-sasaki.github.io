    <!-- (<span class="bold">C</span>omputer <span class="bold">Ar</span>chitecture <span class="bold">a</span>nd <span class="bold">S</span>ecurity)-->
    group at Science Tokyo (formerly Tokyo Tech) where we mainly study computer architecture and computer security. Specifically, we work on improving the security of next generation computing devices and systems by enhancing computer architecture and system software. We also develop reliable and energy-efficient computing systems, and perform workload and system characterization to understand emerging applications.<br><br>
    Prior to joining Science Tokyo, I spent some time in the US at Columbia University and IBM T.J. Watson Research Center. I also did my postdoc at Kyushu University and The University of Tokyo. Even before that, I earned my PhD at The University of Tokyo.<br>
